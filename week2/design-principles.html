                    I think this screenshot is following the rules of visual Hierarchy, because once you get there
                    it is easy to know what is important to do on this side of the web page and where you have to go,
                    the use colors and font size to do this kind of visual, also they have they main product in first
                    place
                    and the rest is following as you scroll down.

                <p>
                    Ikea web site looks always very clean and simply and it is they work really well with the space
                    between graphics, margins, columns, lines, or visuals. It also helps a lot to read the page and
                    to know what to do and where to go. For me, this site does really good work with one of the most
                    an important element of web design.

                <img src="images/footballManager.png" alt="footballManager's website Screenshot">
                <p>
                    I really wanted to find an example for this element and it was not easy but going back to the first
                    website, you can see how they use Repetition in a wise way either to sell or make you remember the brand,
                    they repeat football manager or FM which means the same, as you can see up in the middle and down 
                    in a little message.
